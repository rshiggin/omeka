### Omeka Exhibit for audio and images
This repo includes a complete Omeka instance compiled to host oral history objects and images. It's comprised of a customized Berlin theme, including custom CSS, minor revisions to the PHP scripting, and some embedded HTML5 functions that perform a bit better than Omeka's media plugins. Audio and image content is not included here. 

#### [William H. Sewell Oral Histories](http://www.rshiggins.net/omeka/)  
The creation and administration of this Omeka instance is the sole work of Richard Higgins, who conceived of and built the site for a graduate course on Digital Libraries taught by Professor John A. Walsh in the Department of Information and Library Science at Indiana University - Bloomington.

The audio recordings and text transcriptions at the core of this exhibit are based on interviews conducted from 1976 to 1988 by two oral history projects: one by researchers at the University of Wisconsin and the other by William Sewell's granddaughter, Adrienne Sewell. The recordings from the University of Wisconsin have been publicly available on the UW Library's DSpace institutional repository since at least 2012. The recordings and transcrips created by Adrienne Sewell have been digitized and published for the first time. The UW interviews are now part of the MINDS@UW project.
